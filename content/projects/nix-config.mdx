Setting up my computer is always a pain. I have tried using `.config` symlinking, Ansible and so on, 
but I just never a fan of inventing all the wheels myself (writing symlinking logics for different platforms).

In the end, Nix package manager just solved everything for me. I can finally confidently say with
any new computer I have, I can get dev things running in under an hour :)

Introducing the Nix package manager: it’s been a game-changer. 
With Nix, I can seamlessly replicate my setup on any new machine in under an hour. I’m still working on a streamlined solution for managing SSH keys, but overall, Nix has simplified my setup process significantly and finally made new setups painless.

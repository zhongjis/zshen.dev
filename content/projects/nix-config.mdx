Setting up my computer is always a pain. I have tried using `.config` symlinking, Ansible and so on, but I just never a fan of inventing all the wheels myself (writing symlinking logics for different platforms).

In the end, Nix package manager just solved everything for me. I am still working 
on figure a way to manage my ssh keys, however, I can finally confidently say with
any new computer I have, I can get dev things running in under an hour :)Setting up a new development environment used to be a real hassle. I’ve tried a variety of approaches, from .config symlinking to Ansible, but I never enjoyed reinventing the wheel—especially when it came to writing symlink logic for different platforms.

Enter the Nix package manager: it’s been a game-changer. With Nix, I can seamlessly replicate my setup on any new machine in under an hour. I’m still working on a streamlined solution for managing SSH keys, but overall, Nix has simplified my setup process significantly and finally made new setups painless.
